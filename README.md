## Architecture

**src/objects**
- not initialised with scene
- if they have some painting methods the method accept scene as an argument
- generally core game logic, not to do with user interactions

- **src/objects/railway** is a single railway image
- **src/objects/edge** is a edge that connect two nodes (stations), is a collection of railway images

**src/builders**
- object managers
- accept scene in the constructor

**src/interfaces**

**src/scenes**
